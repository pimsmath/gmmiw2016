<p>Ninety-five percent of Quebec’s Electricity Comes from Hydropower! How the water is used depends on demand (Provincial and American), how much water is currently stored in the reservoir behind the dam, and how much water we expect in the future. If only we knew the future … or were at least able to make an educated guess about the future, we could use optimization schemes to make a choice about how to handle the water,</p>

<p>Unfortunately…. there is a lot of uncertainty in river/reservoir inflows! Our goal is to  create a stochastic method to estimate inflows.</p>

<p>Once we have a stochastic method, we will use it to create simulations for a simplified system of dams including three reservoirs and four dams/generators. 
The simulations will incorporate</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Julia programming language</li>
  <li>the CPLEX optimizer, with previous work from the University of Montreal</li>
  <li>using scenred2 (GAMS) to create scenario trees</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/arbre.jpg" alt="Scenario tree" /></p>

<p>At each time-step the simulation will</p>

<ul>
  <li>create a scenario tree using a large amount of synthetic series created via the stochastic process.</li>
  <li>based on the current state of the system and the scenario tree, the optimizer will create a decision vector.</li>
  <li>progress to the next time step according to the formula:</li>
</ul>

<p>Vol(new) = Vol(prev) + inflows + Vol(upstream) − Vol(turbine) − Vol(spill).</p>

<p>A simulation tool will allow us, or future users, to test and validate different optimizers and stochastic methods!</p>
