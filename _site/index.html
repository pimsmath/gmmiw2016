<h3 id="mentor-chris-budd--university-of-bath-uk">Mentor: Chris Budd,  University of Bath, UK</h3>

<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>
<p>Traffic flow through a city is an important problem for transport planners; traffic jams can have serious economic implications both for the individuals stuck in the jams and the businesses that lose time and revenue as a result. Traffic light signalling is a crucial part of maintaining a good traffic flow and robust algorithms are needed to determine the signal timings. As flow rates increase during peak times, poorly chosen timings will cause the breakdown of the flow, and hence create a traffic jam. Well chosen timings will allow higher flow rates and hence delay the breakdown of the flow, potentially avoiding a traffic jam altogether.</p>

<p>Although many junctions are equipped with traffic sensors in the form of inductance loops buried in the road, a large number of traffic lights are still operated on a fixed timing system. (The fixed times may change throughout the day.) To determine the timings, historical traffic flow data is used. Robust methods are needed to determine appropriate timings given uncertainties in the flow rates.
A further level of sophistication comes when sensor input is available to the traffic light signalling software. The idea is that with accurate arrival data, signal timings can be chosen optimally. Moreover, GPS data from buses and other vehicles on the road may be used to give forecasts of future arrivals.</p>

<p>Desired background for students working in this project include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Differential equations</li>
  <li>Numerical methods</li>
  <li>Perhaps some stochastic methods</li>

<h3 id="mentor-nilima-nigam-simon-fraser-university">Mentor: Nilima Nigam, Simon Fraser University</h3>

<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>
<p>Most rooms for public gatherings will have signage about the maximum lawful capacity of people in the room. Similarly, elevators state a maximum number of people. In this project, the students’ task is to develop a mathematical model to determine the maximum lawful capacity for the Chan Shun Concert Hall in the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts at UBC. Similarly, the students will determine the maximum allowable number of people in the elevators leading to the Chan Centre.</p>

<p>An initial focus is to consider what factors may be important. Layout? Access to exits? Speeds of humans? Seating arrangements? Remember that the Chan Shun Concert Hall has several options for configuration. Would one want to change the maximum lawful capacity in these cases? How will these proposed answers in the project compare to the technical specifications for the venue? Any mathematical model needs to be explicit about any simplifying assumptions and scaling arguments used.</p>

<p>As a more sophisticated variant, suppose the VSO schedules a performance of music aimed at children under 18 months, who are accompanied by at least one adult each. Assume the seats in the Chan Shun Concert Hall can be moved, and that each child will be in a stroller. Determine the maximum capacity of the venue in this case.</p>

<p>With very high probability, if the results of this project determine the lawful capacity is lower than what is stated on the Chan Centre’s website, the students can expect their results to be challenged! The final report needs to include a short statement to the public, defending your model.</p>

  <li>Discrete mathematics</li>
  <li>Statistics and/or stochastics</li>
  <li>Numerical modeling</li>

<h3 id="mentor-brian-wetton-university-of-british-columbia">Mentor: Brian Wetton, University of British Columbia</h3>

<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>
<p>Rechargeable batteries are now standard components in electronic devices and are becoming more widely used in electric vehicles. Lithium ion batteries are one of the most popular types for both of these applications. They have high energy density and a long shelf life, are cheap to construct, and are safe to store and operate (all in comparison to other battery types). In these batteries, energy is stored when Lithium ions enter a solid electrode of layered material. Basic information about Lithium ion batteries can be found, on Wikipedia and at http://batteryuniversity.com/</p>

<p>This project will explore the modelling of small scale Lithium ion batteries for electronic devices. Using experimental data on charging and discharging cycles, we will develop virtual battery simulation tools to predict performance in varying conditions and to develop optimal charging strategies. Models will begin with simple black box (system identification) and equivalent circuit models and can be extended to include more physics and chemistry. As time permits, we can consider using the simulation tools to investigate charging and operation of batteries with different characteristics arranged in parallel and series.</p>

<p>Students may measure battery performance themselves using simple electronic equipment, if time and resources permit. As a backup plan, the experimental data used to develop the models will be taken from the manufacturer’s data and scientific literature.</p>

  <li>Differential equations</li>
  <li>Numerical methods</li>
