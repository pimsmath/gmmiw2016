<h3 id="mentor-tim-myers-centre-de-recerca-matemtica-barcelona">Mentor: Tim Myers, <em>Centre de Recerca Matemàtica, Barcelona</em></h3>

<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>
<p>Nanoparticles are small units of matter with dimensions in the range of 1 to 100 nanometers. They have recently become the focus of intense research due to their unique characteristics. Nanoparticles exhibit many advantageous size-dependent magnetic, electrical, chemical and optical properties, which are not observed at the macroscale. As these properties are extremely sensitive to the particle size, the ability to produce monodisperse particles that lie within a controlled size distribution is critical. In the context of nanoparticles, monodispersity typically refers to size distributions where the standard deviation is less than five percent. Applications that require uniform particles include light emitting diodes, solar energy systems, multi-terabit magnetic storage and biological imaging.</p>

<p>In this project we wish to develop a mathematical model for the growth of spherical nanocrystals from solution. Once the basic model is developed we will extend it to a number of particles and determine the factors controlling the size distribution, with the goal of producing particles of a similar size. We will then look for published experimental data and attempt to fit the model to such data.</p>

<p>Desired background for students working in this project include:
* Partial differential equations
* Numerical methods
* Some physics</p>

<h3 id="mentor-derek-bingham-simon-fraser-university">Mentor: Derek Bingham, Simon Fraser University</h3>

<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>
<p>General Fusion is designing and testing a prototype of a nuclear fusion
reactor with the goal of creating a commercially viable, large - scale
electrical power system.  The system depends on a fundamental physical process
that requires precise control and calibration to function correctly, and needs
optimization to produce an economically viable production operation.</p>

<p>The physics and principles of operation for the device are very complex and
involved , and the prototype is surrounded by a vast array of sensors that
monitors the operation while collecting data on a wide variety of physical
parameters ( which could include temperature, density, pressure, rates of
motion, vibrations, electromagnetic fields, etc.), which are spatially and
temporally sampled at high data rates.</p>

<p>The challenge in this project is to sort through this vast array of data and
select variables that are statistically significant in predicting the operation
of the key parts of the device .  A keen understanding of the problem of
uncovering statistical significance in a large data set will be necessary to
make progress in the project.</p>

<p>Desired background for students working in this project include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Statistics and statistical tests of significance</li>
  <li>Machine learning and numerical methods for data analysis</li>
  <li>Some physics might be beneficial</li>

<h3 id="mentor-fabian-bastin-university-of-montreal">Mentor: Fabian Bastin, <em>University of Montreal</em></h3>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The operation of a hydroelectric generation facility that supplies electrical
power must balance the demands for water flow into the generators with the
availability of water in the large reservoir behind a damn. The electrical power
demand can be predicted quite accurately, but the main uncertainty in the
operation is the source of the water inflows, especially regarding the seasons.
For instance, during Winter, there is practically no inflow of water to the
reservoir, but the electrical demands are quite high.  In the Spring, when the
snow melts, large water inflows occur, while the electrical demand becomes
smaller. Various questions arise in analysing this situation, and the project
will focus on a number of issues, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the modelling of inflows, based on historical data, and the creation of
scenario trees;</li>
  <li>the optimization of reservoirs management. This may include using the
progressive hedging algorithm, a popular but challenging technique in
stochastic programming;</li>
  <li>the numerical simulation of the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>A key goal is to develop a better way to model the uncertainty for this process.
Some initial software models for the system are available, and the student will
be looking to create better, more realistic simulation.  Desired background for
students working in this project include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stochastic processes and stochastic modeling</li>
  <li>Optimization</li>
  <li>Numerical methods</li>
</ul>
