## Project 3: Growth of nanoparticles for industrial production

### Mentor: Tim Myers, *Centre de Recerca Matem√†tica, Barcelona*

### Description: 
Nanoparticles are small units of matter with dimensions in the range of 1 to 100 nanometers. They have recently become the focus of intense research due to their unique characteristics. Nanoparticles exhibit many advantageous size-dependent magnetic, electrical, chemical and optical properties, which are not observed at the macroscale. As these properties are extremely sensitive to the particle size, the ability to produce monodisperse particles that lie within a controlled size distribution is critical. In the context of nanoparticles, monodispersity typically refers to size distributions where the standard deviation is less than five percent. Applications that require uniform particles include light emitting diodes, solar energy systems, multi-terabit magnetic storage and biological imaging.

The physics and principles of operation for the device are very complex and
involved , and the prototype is surrounded by a vast array of sensors that
monitors the operation while collecting data on a wide variety of physical
parameters ( which could include temperature, density, pressure, rates of
motion, vibrations, electromagnetic fields, etc.), which are spatially and
temporally sampled at high data rates. 

The challenge in this project is to sort through this vast array of data and
select variables that are statistically significant in predicting the operation
of the key parts of the device .  A keen understanding of the problem of
uncovering statistical significance in a large data set will be necessary to
make progress in the project. 

Desired background for students working in this project include:

* Statistics and statistical tests of significance
* Machine learning and numerical methods for data analysis
* Some physics might be beneficial
