## Project 2: Variable selection for predicting the quality of a fusion reactor shot

### Mentor: Derek Bingham, *Simon Fraser University*

### Description

A local company, General Fusion, is developing the fastest, most practical, and lowest cost path to commercial fusion energy. 

- Magnetized Target Fusion system uses a sphere, filled with molten lead-lithium that is pumped to form a vortex. 
- On each pulse, magnetically confined plasma is injected into the vortex.- An array of hammers around the sphere impacts and drives a pressure wave into the center of the sphere compressing the plasma to fusion conditions.

It turns out that the technology to effectively develop fusion as a power source is somewhat hard! General Fusion constructs and operates several plasma injectors, each of which can generate a plasma every few minutes, equating to hundreds or thousands of plasmas (or "shots") per week.
- Key issue is maintaining the magnetic properties of the plasma- There are many moving parts and many sensors that track the conditions of their machines
- The company is interested in identifying patterns in their experimental data that will allow the company to further improve the performance of its plasma

The projectâ€™s challenge is to identify variables or features that determine "magnetic life quality" or MQL for the fusion shot under study.
The data involves a great deal of information:- a mix of scalar and time series data- restrict to a simpler set of training data-  40 observations per shot-  80 sensors-  120000 samples per time series-  3 GB to examine.

Both "bone-headed" and "fancy" choices as statistical summaries of time series (min/max, norms, wavelet coefficients, selective curve averaging, etc.)

A sample predictor with one sensor gives the following plot for predicting MLQ quality.

Wavelet regression, LASSO to promote sparsity, automated algorithms to select an ensemble predictor gives promising results, as shown in the following plot of predicted versus observed shot MLQ quality.

Ensemble Prediction:
- regression problem leads to an unbalanced binary classification problem-  data feeds into the algorithm, results in a  disjoint subsets of variables- each subset of variables forms a model for the ensemble
