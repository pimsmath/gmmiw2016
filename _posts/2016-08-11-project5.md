## Project 5: Modelling the performance of rechargable Li-Ion batteries

### Mentor: Brian Wetton, *University of British Columbia*

### Description

A lithium-ion battery (Li-ion battery) is a member of afamily of rechargeable battery types in which lithium ionsmove from the negative electrode to the positive electrodeduring discharge and back when charging.

Li-ion batteries have many positive features:- High energy density.- Long stable power and long run time.- Ideal for notebook, PCs, boosters, portable devices, etc.
- Packs of cells can be linked in series or parallel for high power applications.

Charging (and discharging) follow specific curves for optimal performance. A well-designed charger forces both current and voltage levels to appropriate levels during the charging cycle. In discharge, various loads imply various levels of power availability.

### First Targets
- State of Charge (SOC) and the Voltage/Current during charging algebraically determines the rate of change in the battery charge. Find this data experimentally. - Find an empirical fit to this relationship.- Determine an equivalent circuit models or system identification (black box fit).- Fit a model for parallel and series cells toinvestigate the performance and failure statistics in parallel versus seriesdesigns.

Here are some sample charging curves, fit with empirical splines:

### Mathematical model for the battery circuit

$$R_2 C \frac{dV}{dt} + V = R_2 C \frac{dE}{dt} - C R_1 R_2 \frac{di}{dt} + E - (R_1 + R_2)i$$

where the $R_k$ are resistances, $C$ capacitance, $V$ is voltage, $E$ the equilibrium potential and $i$ the current. A representation of the equivalent circuit for a lithium-ion cell is shown in the following circuit.

### Second Targets: Series and Parallel Arrangements
- Suitable statistics for battery variability.- Models of batteries with different characteristics connected inseries and parallel. 
- Charging and Discharging.- Extreme cases: failure mechanisms.- Feedback: are “weak” batteries put under more stress whenconnected?- Explain why the Tesla battery bricks are connected in parallel,not in series.

### Ongoing work- validation with experimental data for constant resistance- parallel and series cell model- describe the model by the system of differential algebraic equations
