## Project 3: Growth of monodispersed nanoparticles in a supersaturated solution

### Mentor: Tim Myers, *Centre de Recerca Matem√†tica, Barcelona*

### Description

What is nanotechnology? From Wikipedia: The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products. A more generalizeddescription of nanotechnology was subsequently established by theNational Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as themanipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100nanometers.

The term has evolved over the years via terminology drift to mean"anything smaller than microtechnology" such as nano powders, andother things that are nanoscale in size.

Why are nanoparticles different than bulk materials?- Nanoparticles have a large ratio of surface to volume atoms- Surface atoms have different/less bonds than interior atoms- This leads to unique size-dependent electrical, chemical, optical and magnetic properties- Lower melt temperatures, higher chemical reactivity.

A significant challenge is to produce industrial quantities of nanoparticles of uniform size with specific characteristics. Two basic ways to build them:

- Top down: start with bulk material, and grind down to particles
- Bottom up: start with a gas or liquid solution, and assemble atom-by-atom.

Precipitation from solution is one of the most popular synthesismethods. But: - The precise relationship between particle growth andsystem conditions is not fully understood.-  To reach a more thermodynamically stable state,larger particles grow at the expense of smaller dissolving particles.
This is known as Ostwald ripening.Aim:Predict the evolution of the nanoparticle size distributionduring growth from solution. Reduce the problem of Ostwald ripening, where the size distribution of particles tends to spread, as in the expanding Gaussian below.  The goal is to achieve size-focussing in the particle production.

In the case of particle growth from solution, the individual particles grow with an expanding radius as the material diffuses from solution onto the surface of the growing particle. A dimensionless partial differential equation is obtained to connect the concentration of solution with the radius of the particle, as a function of time. 

$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = 
   2D \frac{\overline{C}}{L^2} \frac{\partial C}{\partial r} + 
   \frac{D\overline{C}}{L^2} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial r^2}. $$

After several approaches to simplifying and approximating solutions, a curve is obtained demonstrating the rate at with the radius grows, as a function of time. A sample numerical solution is displayed as follows.

The next stages in the project are to improve these numerical solution to compare with analytical results, and then extend to many particles in solution in order to study the Ostwald ripening effect.
