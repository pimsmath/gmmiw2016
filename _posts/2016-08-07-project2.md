## Project 2: Variable selection problem and statistical prediction for an industrial reactor

### Mentor: Derek Bingham, *Simon Fraser University*

### Description: 
A local company is designing and testing a prototype of a certain type of
industrial device with the goal of creating a commercially viable, large - scale
electrical power system.  The system depends on a fundamental physical process
that requires precise control and calibration to function correctly, and needs
optimization to produce an economically viable production operation.

The physics and principles of operation for the device are very complex and
involved , and the prototype is surrounded by a vast array of sensors that
monitors the operation while collecting data on a wide variety of physical
parameters ( which could include temperature, density, pressure, rates of
motion, vibrations, electromagnetic fields, etc.), which are spatially and
temporally sampled at high data rates. 

The challenge in this project is to sort through this vast array of data and
select variables that are statistically significant in predicting the operation
of the key parts of the device .  A keen understanding of the problem of
uncovering statistical significance in a large data set will be necessary to
make progress in the project. 

Desired background for students working in this project include:

* Statistics and statistical tests of significance
* Machine learning and numerical methods for data analysis
* Some physics might be beneficial
