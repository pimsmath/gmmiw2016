Welcome to the 2016 Graduate Math Modelling in Industry Workshop. 

Over the next week, graduate students from all over the world will gather to
work side-by-side with industry leaders. They will develop and apply their
mathematical expertise on cutting edge problems from areas such as

  * Stochastic modelling for hydro-electric reservoir management     Fabian Bastin - University of Montreal
  * Variable selection problem and statistical prediction for an industrial reactor  Derek Bingham - Simon Fraser University
  * Growth of nanoparticles for industrial production    Tim Myers - Centre de Recerca Matem√†tica, Spain
  * This party is too big, folks" - Setting room capacities for safety.     Nilima Nigam - Simon Fraser University
  * Modelling the performance of rechargable Li-Ion batteries    Brian Wetton - University of British Columbia
  * Modelling and optimisation of traffic light systems  Chris Budd - University of Bath, UK 



Check out the [GMMIW Event Page](http://www.pims.math.ca/industrial-event/160807-gmmiw) for full details of the problems.
