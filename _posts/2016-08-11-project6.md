## Project 6: Modelling and optimisation of traffic light systems

### Mentor: Chris Budd, *University of Bath*

### Description

Proposed by Halcrow (Bruce Slattery) for the 2013 Europeanstudy group with industry at Bristol, UK.A good traffic flow is critical for the continued operation of anymajor city; traffic jams are at best inconvenient and are oftenmuch worse.Road junctions, particularly where there are trafficc lights, are theplaces that the traffic flow will break down first.How can the timings of traffic light signals be chosento delay the onset of a traffic jam as much as possible and ensurea maximum flow of people (in cars and buses)?

We set up 1D and 2D models for single intersections. 

Variables:

- $q$, the number of cars in a queue
- $t_G$ : duration of green light- $t_R$: duration of red light- $T = t_G + t_R$: duration of light cycle- $\rho$: rate at which cars leave queue
- $\lambda$: rate at which cars join queue

Initial Assumptions- Saturation:  $ \rho -\lambda < \frac{dq}{dt}$- No priority (buses, ambulances, etc)- No pedestrians- Constant $\rho$- Poisson Process for arrival (i.e. $\lambda$)

Optimality:

- $\min \sum q_i$- $\min \overline{q}$ where $\overline{q} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T q(t)dt$
- $\min ( \max q_i)$
- minimize average waiting time for cars in queue

We run the model for a variety of parameter settings, to look for plausible behaviour.

For further work, we can gather data from Vancouver's online database of car behaviour at various intersections, and at various times of day.

### What we are going to do- Increase dimension, i.e. 4-way intersection- Include priority for buses, emergency vehicles, etc.- Include pedestrians and cyclists- Multiple intersections- Include different  values for different directions of travelthrough intersection, i.e. left turn, right turn, straight- Compare model to data- Optimization- Add stochasticity- Make signal more realistic, i.e. yellow, overlapping red
